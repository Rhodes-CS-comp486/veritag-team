Combined Grade: 83

## Planning Document Feedback (Group): 

- Your system description is a good start. You still have a little bit of work before it will be ready as an abstract for Rhodes Symposium. Something about the two types of users seems critical for explaining the application.
- Your architecture/high-level design details weren't clear in your plan document. I was expecting to see a list of the major system components, some explanation of those components, and then the system diagram that shows how they work together. I only saw the system diagram, which was given to you in the project description document.
- Your epics are not structured as user stories. Remember epics are just large user stories. You have a nice list of user stories, but those are really for the Trello board, not the planning document.
- Your non-functional requirements are great!
- You need to give more details in your technologies and frameworks section. You should specify the languages (e.g., Python), frameworks (e.g., django or flask), and libraries (e.g., beautiful soup, urllib for the web scraper) that you plan to use.
- You didn't provide an MVP! That will cost you some points. :(
- Your roadmap is not very clear, and you didn't identify when your MVP would be completed by.
- Your planning document still needs some work. Correct some of the issues I mention above (in particular, make sure you add an MVP), and I will give you some points back.

## Requirements Feedback (Group): 

- Your users stories are generally very good. Based on your acceptance criteria, I think you could break up many of your stories into much smaller user stories. For example, US4 includes posting, viewing, and sorting comments. Each of these could be their own user story.
- Your titles are consistently formatted and generally very clear in their intent.
- All of your stories are traceable to epics.
- Your acceptance criteria is defined for all of your stories and generally very good.
- You have estimates for all of your stories, which is great.
- Your stories look nicely prioritized based on your roadmap plans. Good job!
